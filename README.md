## Portfolio
### Portfolio 1: Heart Disease Data Exploration
As the largest single cause of death on the planet, heart disease is an important and life or death matter. With increasing number of people of being diagnosed of heart disease all over the world, it is paramount to study the symptoms correlates with the disease as well as identify the population that is susceptible to this kind of disease for early prevention.

### Portfolio 2: World Happiness Report
With increasingly fast pace of the society and high suicide rate, mental health has recently come to the center of people’s attention, and more and more citizens around the world plan to move permanently to a place with less stress and more happiness to improve their mental conditions. World happiness report is a reliable source of reference in this case, focusing on general happiness and well-being. This report also collects information about economy, health, social support, government policies and so on. This report aims to analyze the world happiness dataset to see which region has the best happiness value and what are the key factors influencing people’s well-being. The data used in this report is 2015 world happiness dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). The dataset includes data from 153 different countries all over the world.

### Portfolio 3: Jane Austin
I personally enjoy reading books written by Jane Austen, and in this project, I am going to explore the relationships between vocabulary in Austen’s book to draw interesting findings using a correlation network graph in a shiny app. In terms of relationships between words, I am interested in if there are any words tend to follow others immediately and why this kind of pattern occurs. To achieve the above objective, I used a package called ‘janeaustenr’ which contains the text of 6 different novels written by Jane Austen, including Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion. I tokenized the novel into pairs of adjacent words rather than divide the novel into individual words to explore the relationship between pairs of adjacent words. This technique is similar to bigram in the language model, but instead of calculating the conditional probability in bigram, I generated pairwise correlation of word pairs.

### Portfolio 4: Heart Disease Data Exploration (extension)
This portfolio is revised upon the first portfolio about heart disease data exploration. As the largest single cause of death on the planet, heart disease is an important and life or death matter. With increasing number of people of being diagnosed of heart disease all over the world, it is paramount to study the symptoms correlates with the disease as well as identify the population that is susceptible to this kind of disease for early prevention.

### Project Introduction
Driving is the most popular mode of transportation that Americans use to commute between home and work. However, traffic accidents can result in road crash fatalities and disabilities, which is being recognized as a major public health concern. We believe that minimizing traffic violations would prevent severe accidents and create safer local communities. Therefore, we aim to investigate if there's any patterns in traffic violations based on population demographics of racial groups, age groups, and gender by studying a Maryland County traffic violations dataset. By studying demographic relationships with traffic violations, we hope that policymakers will be able to come up with a plan tailored to the specific social group where traffic violations and accidents will be minimized in the future. We used the "Traffic and Drugs Related Violations" dataset, which includes 12 variables, such as driver’s age, gender, and race, relating to 65,000 traffic records in Maryland.
